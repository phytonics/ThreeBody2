To install tris and all its dependencies, the easiest method would be to use pip to query PyPI. This should, by default, be present in your Python installation. To, install run the following command in a terminal or Command Prompt / Powershell: $ pip install tris Depending on the OS, you might need to use pip3 instead. If the command is not found, you can choose to use the following command too: $ python -m pip install tris Here too, python or pip might be replaced with py or python3 and pip3 depending on the OS and installation configuration. If you have any issues with this, it is always helpful to consult Stack Overflow . Installing from Source To install from source, you need to get the following: Git Git is needed to install this repository. This is not completely necessary as you can also install the zip file for this repository and store it on a local drive manually. To install Git, follow this guide . After you have successfully installed Git, you can run the following command in a terminal / Command Prompt etc: $ git clone https://github.com/three-body-analysis/codebase.git This stores a copy in the folder codebase . You can then navigate into it using cd codebase . Poetry This project can be used easily via a tool know as Poetry. This allows you to easily reflect edits made in the original source code! To install poetry , you can also install it using pip by typing in the command as follows: $ pip install poetry Again, if you have any issues with pip , check out here .
